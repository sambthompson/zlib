zlib 1.0.6 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code
is reentrant (thread safe).  The data format used by the zlib library
is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files 
ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate
format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available in
other formats from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file
zlib.h. A usage example of the library is given in the file example.c
which also tests that the library is working correctly. Another
example is given in the file minigzip.c. The compression library itself
is composed of all source files except example.c and minigzip.c.

To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions
given at the top of Makefile. In short "make test; make install"
should work for most machines.  For MSDOS, use one of the special
makefiles such as Makefile.msc; for VMS, use Make_vms.com or descrip.mms.

Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available in

The changes made in version 1.0.6 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
The main changes since 1.0.4 are:

- add functions gzprintf, gzputc, gzgetc, gztell, gzeof, gzseek, gzrewind and
  gzsetparams (thanks to Roland Giersig and Kevin Ruland for some of this code)
- Fix a deflate bug occuring only with compression level 0 (thanks to
  Andy Buckler for finding this one).
- In minigzip, pass transparently also the first byte for .Z files.
- return Z_BUF_ERROR instead of Z_OK if output buffer full in uncompress()
- check Z_FINISH in inflate (thanks to Marc Schluper)
- Implement deflateCopy (thanks to Adam Costello)
- make static libraries by default in configure, add --shared option.
- move MSDOS or Windows specific files to directory msdos
- suppress the notion of partial flush to simplify the interface
  (but the symbol Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH is kept for compatibility with 1.0.4)
- suppress history buffer provided by application to simplify the interface
  (this feature was not implemented anyway in 1.0.4)
- next_in and avail_in must be initialized before calling inflateInit or
  inflateInit2
- add EXPORT in all exported functions (for Windows DLL)
- added the unsupported "contrib" directory:

	386 asm code replacing longest_match().
   contrib/iostream/ by Kevin Ruland <kevin@rodin.wustl.edu>
        A C++ I/O streams interface to the zlib gz* functions
   contrib/iostream2/  by Tyge Løvset <Tyge.Lovset@cmr.no>
	Another C++ I/O streams interface
   contrib/untgz/  by "Pedro A. Aranda Guti\irrez" <paag@tid.es>
   contrib/visual-basic.txt by Carlos Rios <c_rios@sonda.cl>
        How to use compress(), uncompress() and the gz* functions from VB.
- pass params -f (filtered data), -h (huffman only), -1 to -9 (compression
  level) in minigzip (thanks to Tom Lane)


A Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java Development Kit 1.1
http://www.javasoft.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/Package-java.util.zip.html
See the zlib home page http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/ for details.

A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmarquess@bfsec.bt.co.uk>
is in the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, such as:
ftp://ftp.cis.ufl.edu/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/Compress/Compress-Zlib*

A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@magnet.com>
is available from the Python Software Association sites, such as:
ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/python/contrib/Encoding/zlib*.tar.gz

Notes for some targets:

- To build a Windows DLL version, include in a DLL project zlib.def, zlib.rc
  and all .c files except example.c and minigzip.c; compile with -DZLIB_DLL
  The zlib DLL support was initially done by Alessandro Iacopetti and is
  now maintained by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>. Check the zlib DLL
  home page at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll

  From Visual Basic, you can call the DLL functions which do not take
  a structure as argument: compress, uncompress and all gz* functions.
  I don't know how to handle structures in Visual Basic, sorry.

- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization.
  With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with
  the -n32 compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.

- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1   
  it works when compiled with cc.

- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with one cc compiler (the one not
  accepting the -O option). It works with the other cc compiler.

- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS

- For Turbo C the small model is supported only with reduced performance to
  avoid any far allocation; it was tested with -DMAX_WBITS=11 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=3


Acknowledgments:

  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate
  and zlib specifications were written by Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the
  people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib;
  they are too numerous to cite here.
